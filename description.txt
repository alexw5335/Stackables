- Increases stack size of all equipable items that have the same prefix to 9999
- Fixes a few bugs with stackable equipables that other mods don't address, such as not being able to right-click equip them or reforge them
- Items that now stack include armour, accessories, weapons
- Prevents items that are dropped by enemies or found in chests from having prefixes, which allows them to stack easily, which reduces inventory clutter
- This mod has not been tested much and may be incompatible with other mods
